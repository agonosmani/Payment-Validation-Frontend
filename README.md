# Payment-Validation-Frontend

<h4>A step by step guide on how to run the front-end part of the application: </h4>

<p>First we have to make sure that the Backend is already running. If the backend is already running, we can start by cloning the front-end project into a local directory.</p>

<p>Then we have to open the project from our IDE on a seperate window from the backend project. In the terminal, we have to make sure we are on the current directory (Payment-Validation-Frontend-main).</p>

<p>We run the command "npm install" to download all the node modules, and after that follows the command "npm start". Subsequently, the application will start running on localhost on port 3000, so we can access it from the browser. </p>
